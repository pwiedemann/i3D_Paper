\section{Introduction}
Rendering photo-realistic appearances entails solving the \textit{rendering equation} for each point on an objects surface. This computation can be extremely demanding, especially considering global illumination effects where the problem becomes highly recursive. \\
\textit{Precomputed Radiance Transfer} (PRT) is a technique addressed to overcome this computational overkill, simplifying the rendering equation but still enabling high-quality renderings for complex illuminations. The quintessence is to perform a single pre-computation step of the light-transport information and only evaluate the equation at runtime.\\
Classic PRT algorithms function well for static scenes; however, these are destined to fail eyeing dynamic and/or interactive environments, in which considered objects undergo significant deformations.
Responsible is a term in the rendering equation called the \textit{transfer function} which is fully dependent on the shape of the surface. That is, any object deformation implies a re-computation of \textit{transfer function},  requiring expensive ray-casting. Hence, using classic PRT to render deformable objects would involve pre-computing large amounts of data, leading to immense storage consumptions. \\
On top of that, the costly and memory consuming pre-computation of these \textit{transfer functions}, presumes knowledge of all future deformations of the regarded object. Nevertheless, dynamic or interactive scenes may require on-the-fly adaptive, previously unknown, object deformations. Examples of such are: 
interactive physically based deformations for cloth or soft-bodies [find references] ; 
or more recently developed character animations that involve automatic on-the-fly pose adaptation [for instance, Holden paper, deepmotion,etc...]. \\
\\
We propose a Deep Learning framework addressed to overcome the limitations of traditional PRT algorithms described above. We call this approach \textit{Deep Precomputed Radiance Transfer} (DPRT). In particular, we replace expensive ray-casting algorithms by a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that, for a given deformation, infers the corresponding set of SH - coefficients that represent the \textit{transfer function}. 
Thus, regardless of the number of deformations our method maintains a constant size (fixed storage consumption). Moreover, due to the inherent generalisation capabilities of DNN's, DPRT is able to accurately predict appearances of previously unknown shapes. \\

The main contributions of our approach are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item enabling arbitrary and adaptive deformations,
\item while maintaining a compact representation. 
\end{itemize}
