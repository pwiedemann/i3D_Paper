\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We present a compact representation of PRT for \textbf{free form} deformable objects, in form of a non-linear model, namely a deep \textit{Convolutional Neural Network} (CNN).  The model is able to extract the features of the dataset relevant to self-shadowing and thus generate good approximations for a wide spectrum of deformations. The results show that our CNN is able to faithfully predict appearances that are visually undistinguishable from the ground truth.  With this in mind we showed that compared to traditional PRT methods, DPRT leads to immense memory savings.
\\ 
Moreover, our method shows much higher generalisation properties than previous approaches allowing deformations from much larger and less constrained deformation spaces.\\
\\
Although we showed DPRT to be much more compact than traditional approaches, our network is far from being optimal, speed and size wise. Network optimisation methods would enhance our DPRT approach significantly \cite{Survey_NN_Compression}, \cite{Deep_Compression}.
Moreover, other network topologies and/or cost functions could be explored in order to achieve even better approximations.\\
\\
The particular choice of our basis functions (\textit{Spherical Harmonics}), currently restricts our method to low-frequency lightings. However, an extension to all-frequencies is possible by fitting the model to an alternative representation of $T$, such as non-linear Wavelets \cite{AllFrequencyPRT}.
\\
Significant restrictions of our method reside within the choice of our parametrisation (Harmonic Map).  Currently, DPRT only performs well for modest curvature variations, however, using the \textit{Strech-Minimising} parametrisation instead and further using the extension proposed by \cite{Spherical_Parametrization}, the shape representation would be more robust and our method would be applicable to more general surface shapes. \\
Apart from that, alternative surface representations could be explored to overcome this restrictions natural flaws of \textit{Geometry Images}.
