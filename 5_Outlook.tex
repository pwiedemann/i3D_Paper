\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We present a compact representation of PRT for deformable objects by introducing a non-linear function, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to approximate the \textit{Transfer Function} for a given shape query. As a result, our proposed CNN is able to make accurate approximations generating appearances that are visually undistinguishable from the ground truth. Moreover, our method shows much higher generalisation properties than previous approaches allowing deformations from a much larger and less constrained deformation space.\\
\\
The particular choice of our basis functions (\textit{Spherical Harmonics}), currently restricts our method to low-frequency lightings. However, an extension to all-frequencies is straught forward and can be made by fitting the model to an alternative representation of $T$, such as non-linear Wavelets \cite{AllFrequencyPRT}.\\
The most significant restrictions of our method reside within the natural flaws of \textit{Geometry Images}. Currently, our algorithm can only operate on surfaces containing one boundary and performs well for modest curvature variations. In future, alternative surface representations could be explored to overcome this restrictions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Geo.image resolution limited to powers of 2 (256 , 512, ...)
\item Harmonic map -> stretch min. map
\end{itemize}
